No news is good news. That's what gwchen told me. 
How about me in the recent life ? Just back to the begining for learning something.

I have left my last job for four monthes. In these days, I have 

* Learned
    * basic Haskell programming (including basic Monad)
    * basic parallel and concurrent programming
    * basic linux system programming through reading [TLPI](http://man7.org/tlpi/)
* Practiced English
    * Watch CNN Student news for one and half month
    * Read/ Listen several Time articles in one month 

What's the next step ? I don't know.
The only thing I know is that I will following my mind.

<!-- I have some interesting in parallel programming, especially combining with FP. -->

<!-- Althgough it's all about monads for parallel programming in Haskell, it's easy
to start write program with parallel paradigm in haskell. The basic method is 
to add parallel strategy to your `map` function. The next step is to locate the
data dependency among the program. I have only learned the two steps of parallel
programming in Haskell. -->
